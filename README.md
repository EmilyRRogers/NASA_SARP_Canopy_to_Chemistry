During the summer of 2024, I participated in NASA's Student Airborne Research Program in California. I had the opportunity to collect whole air samples and assist in operating analytical instruments aboard NASA's P-3 and a King Air B-200. I then assisted in ground-truthing of airborne and satellite-based observations at Sedgwick Reserve in Santa Barbara County, California.

For my independent project as part of the Terrestrial Ecology Group, I chose to study the relationship between vegetation phenology and isoprene emission using satellite remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence estimates and formaldehyde vertical column measurements. This analysis provides insight into how plants influence the chemistry of Earth's atmosphere as they respond to changes in their environment. 

This project was advised by Dr. Daniel Sousa, Megan Ward-Baranyay, and Dr. Disha Sardana. Data was analyzed using a Python interface to Remote Sensing Information Gateway (RSIG) data developed by Barron H. Henderson

# Abstract

Isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) represents the most abundant non-methane biogenic volatile organic compound in the troposphere, with annual emissions almost equal to those of methane. Depending on the chemical environment, this effective thermoregulator and reactive oxygen species scavenger participates in photochemical reactions to produce climate pollutants and toxins such as ozone and secondary organic aerosols. Previous studies have revealed strong connections between isoprene emission and photosynthesis as its precursors are formed during the Calvin Cycle. This raises questions as to whether the periodic biological events of plants, collectively known as vegetation phenology, influences tropospheric isoprene quantities. In this study, we investigate the influence of vegetation phenology on isoprene emission in Southern California by comparing photosynthetic activity and the spatial distribution of the isoprene oxidation product, formaldehyde, for regions dominated by plants of two different physiologies: high altitude woodlands and coastal shrublands. We interrogate the annual phenology of these regions using high-resolution solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) estimates from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite, and formaldehyde vertical column measurements from the recently activated Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) geostationary satellite. We explore the seasonal trends in both formaldehyde formation and SIF as well as their bivariate relationship. Preliminary results indicate both heightened formaldehyde emission and heightened SIF during summer months relative to winter months, with a comparatively stronger correlation between the two metrics during the fall. Our findings will provide insight toward the response of plants to variations in their environment which directly influence chemical systems in the air. Whereas VOCs hold great potential for environmental and anthropological harm if emitted in excess, it is crucial to understand the factors involved in their formation. As such, we hope that our findings provide information relevant to the development of air pollution mitigation strategies.
